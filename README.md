Lambda Expression and Anonymous Class Examples!

What is a Lambda Expression? 
Java lambda expressions are new in Java 8. 
A Java lambda expression is thus a function which can be created without belonging to any class. A Java lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.
Java lambda expressions are commonly used to implement simple event listeners / callbacks, or in functional programming with the Java Streams API.

What is a Anonymous Class?</p>
Anonymous class is an inner class without a name only a single object is created from one 
The object may have “extras” or "changes"and no need to create a separate innerclass when it is only need it once. 
Helps us to avoid cluttering code with a class name	</p>	
Syntax is similar to a constructor, except that there is also a class definition within a block of code. <
